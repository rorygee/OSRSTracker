# OSRS Tracker
Currently consists of an database interface and a pretty looking graphical view for recorded experience data from a given Old School Runescape account.

A few other features are being worked on, including alternate graph types and (hopefully) a live graph for viewing experience gains over a single session, but this will be limited by the frequency at which Jagex updates experience records.

In the middle of transitioning to a new database handling module that uses a more sane DB toolkit.

## Prerequisites
